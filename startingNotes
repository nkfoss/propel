Ideas:
Disemvowel (obviously....)

inputs:
A sentence (string, no matter what size).
	- A word with n-number of vowels

Parts: 
string_includes?
[a,e,i,o,u] (constants)
in1

Fitness fxn:
- Removes no vowels (BIG ERROR)
- Removes some voewls (less error) (ratio? something else?)
- Removes all vowels (no error, unless removes consonants)

- Look at the output, check the length. Return an abs val of the difference of the expected length, and return length. If not 0, penalize.
- Check the content of the string. If it contains vowels, penalize (this increases expontentially with each vowel)


Requirements:
- for the fitness fxn... we need a function that identifies consonants and vowels 
	(if this is required for fitness eval)
- 




Fibonacci (given a number 'n', return the nth fibonacci number)

Summation (given an integer 'n', return sum(0,1,...n) )


We found it tedious to scroll through 500+ lines of code in propel.core, so propel.core was refactored into four different parts:
	default instructions, utilities, instructions and interpreter.
